I decided to use the blog app from this weekend as our project doesn't have any full CRUD routes.

I've changes my articles resource to custom routes.  I'm getting the following error that 
I have been unable to fix without altering my view page:

if I change new_articles_path to articles_new_path, the routing works correctly.  I uncovered
this by inspecting the routes

I'm not sure where to go from here.  I'm sure there has to be a way to write the routes
so that they are matched to new_article_path, but I've been unable to find it.

Any words of advise on this problem would be helpful.
